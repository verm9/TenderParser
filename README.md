"# TenderParser" 
It is a Java8 app that parses tenders from https://www.fabrikant.ru and http://etprf.ru/. Uses an architecture based on
Strategy pattern, so new sites for parsing can be easily added.

Written in Intellij IDEA 2016, uses Jsoup library (which is placed in ./lib/jsoup-1.9.2.jar).

To run an artifact use RUN.bat. After the program was executed open items.html in your browser.

Original idea belongs to javarush.ru :: lesson 28.
